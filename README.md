# Numerical_Methods_of_Multidimensional_Minimization_by_first-order_Derivatives
Numerical methods of multidimensional minimization using first-order derivatives to solve problems of multidimensional minimization by various numerical methods of the first order.

## Task:
it is required to find the absolute minimum of a function of many variables y = f(x1, . . . , xn), that is, a point x^* ∈ Rn such that f(x^*) = min f(x)
